PyTubeGet v1.0.2
================

- Fixed a critical issue that prevented the program from running via
  the .exe file, as it was internally still attempting to load the 
  window icon from 'resources' instead of using the icon embedded 
  within the executable

- Fixed an issue where the progress bar was not being used or updated 
  when downloading playlists

- Fixed an issue where video files downloaded from a playlist did not 
  have the .mp4 extension at the end of their name
